# Devops Challenge for Candidates

In order to assess a candidate's ability to perform hands-on devops tasks, we provide the following exercise. It's expected to take about one hour. Candidates are welcome to use Google, StackOverflow, and any other resources that will help them in this process and to ask questions of the interviewer.

If the candidate wishes to use their own computer, they're welcome to. Otherwise, one will be provided. Additionally, an SSH-accessible EC2 instance will be provided. It will be provisioned with the following tools:

* Nodejs
* Docker
* The AWS command-line tool configured with sufficient credentials to complete the task.

## The exercise

* Create a nodejs application that responds to requests with "Hello, world."
* Build a docker container to run that application.
* Deploy that container to the web.
